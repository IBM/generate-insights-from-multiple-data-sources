# Summary

Data and business analysis is a very valuable skill to have. It could mean the difference between a mediocre business and an exceptional one. For any company to do Data or Business analysis, having appropriate amount of data is the key.A company's data may have been stored on multiple sources. If we are able to aggregate all this related data which is stored on multiple sources and perform analysis, it would be very useful for the business, to interpret the data and to take right decision in accordance with the business environment. It could mean the difference between a mediocre business and an exceptional one.

# Description

In today's digital world, data analysis is extremely necessary due to the presence of online businesses.
Such, businesses can have its consumer base completely stolen by a competitor with a better understanding of the consumers' needs,
compared to a brick-and-mortar stall,which may still draw business from random passers-by.

Data and business analysis is a very valuable skill to have. It could mean the difference between a mediocre business and an exceptional one. For any company to do Data or Business analysis, having appropriate amount of data is the key.

A company's data may have been stored on multiple sources. In this code pattern we will consume/extract the data from multiple data sources using Watson Studio and load it into one data file/database. This data will further be used for visualization and analysis, and to derive insights about the company's performance.

# Flow
